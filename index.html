        <p>For California residents only, when you enrolled you paid an assessment to the Student Tuition Recovery Fund (STRF). The State of California created STRF to relieve or mitigate economic losses suffered by California residents who were students while attending certain schools regulated by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education (BPPE).</p>
        <p>Representatives from the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education will be contacting you directly to discuss your options and explain the STRF program noted below.</p>
        <p>You may be eligible for STRF if you are a California Resident; prepaid tuition, paid the STRF assessment, and suffered an economic loss as a result of any of the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The school closed before the course of instruction was completed.</li>
            <li>The school's failure to pay refunds or charges on behalf of the student to a third party for license fees or any other purpose, or to provide equipment or materials for which a charge was collected within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days before the closure of the school.</li>
            <li>The school's failure to pay or reimburse loan proceeds under a federally guaranteed student loan program as required by law or to pay or reimburse proceeds received by the school prior to closure in excess of tuition or other cost.</li>
            <li>There was a decline in the quality of the course of instruction within thirty (30) calendar days before the school closed or, if the decline began earlier than thirty (30) calendar days prior to closure, the period of decline determined by the Bureau.</li>
            <li>An inability to collect on a judgment against the institution for a violation of the California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 2009.</li>
        </ol>
